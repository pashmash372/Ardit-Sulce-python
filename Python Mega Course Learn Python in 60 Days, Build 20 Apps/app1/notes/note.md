Single quotes vs double quotes

```python
# when to use single quotes vs double quotes ?
# single quotes are used for strings that contain double quotes
# double quotes are used for strings that contain single quotes
# triple quotes are used for strings that contain both single and double quotes

# example of single quotes
print('I said, "Hello" to you.')
# example of double quotes
print("I said, 'Hello' to you.")
# example of triple quotes
print('''I said, "Hello" to you.''')
print("""I said, 'Hello' to you.""")
print('''I said, "Hello" to you.''')

#  which is better to use single quotes or double quotes ?
# it doesn't matter, just be consistent
# if you use single quotes, then you don't have to escape double quotes
```

##### CHEAT CODE PYTHON

list problem

why use list append instead of list add?

```python
# capitalize vs title
# capitalize: first letter of the string
# title: first letter of each word in the string
#
# "hello world".capitalize()  # "Hello world"
# "hello world".title()  # "Hello World"
# "hello world".upper()  # "HELLO WORLD"
# "HELLO WORLD".lower()  # "hello world"

```

How to find the code you need

![img_5.png](img_5.png)

You can use python console to find the code you need
use dir(str) to find all the methods of a string

help(str.upper) to find the documentation of a method

help(list.append) to find the documentation of a method
more info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

import builtins
dir(builtins) to find all the built-in functions

Python works the same.
This is you again.
And you want to communicate with the processor of your computer.
For example, you want to know the sum of three and four.
The problem again is that the processor speaks a very difficult language called machine language.
And this language is very hard for humans to speak or to write.
So what we get is an interpreter called C Python.
So what is C python?
C Python is the software we installed in the previous videos.
So when you download python from Python dot org and you install it, what you're installing is actually
C python.
It's an interpreter.
This interpreter gets Python language from you, and it translates that language to machine language,
and it speaks that machine language to the processor.
In return, the processor uses the computer display so your laptop screen to display the results.
The software you install and you use to execute Python is just a software and it's written in C language.
That's why it's called C Python, even though most people refer to it as just Python.
When you say did you install Python?
Well, you're speaking of installing C python.
The python language itself is just knowledge.
It's stored in documentation.
If you go to python dot org and then go to the documentation menu, then you should see the documentation
of Python..
